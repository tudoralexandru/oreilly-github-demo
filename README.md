My Lovely Project
=================

A great example repo you can fork to your heart’s content, that serves as a launchpad for working your way through the amazing **[Learning GitHub](http://shop.oreilly.com/category/videos/programming.do)** video training series.

## Getting started

The first thing you want to do with this repo is quite likely **fork it**.  Use the Fork button in the top-right section of the page to do this.

Once you’re on your fork, you can experiment however you like with it, play with [branches](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-branches), [issues](https://www.google.ro/search?client=safari&source=hp&ei=glPFXeiGGcz6qwGevrjwDA&q=github+issues&oq=github+issues&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0l10.1338.3301..3412...0.0..1.266.1258.12j0j1......0....1..gws-wiz.2UM9hntiag0&ved=0ahUKEwjoz4Ksw9rlAhVM_SoKHR4fDs4Q4dUDCAk&uact=5), [milestones](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-milestones), labels, the wiki, and more.

## What’s in there?

Various files to support upcoming GitHub tasks the series trains you for, but more importantly, demonstration out-of-codebase contents (e.g. issues and milestones) so you can get a feeling of what features GitHub offers without having to first create such content or data.  The video series frequently uses this repository as a way of touring trainees briefly through these features before tackling them.
